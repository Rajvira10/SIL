                1. Recruit 30 youngsters for each club
                <br />
                2. Train them on interpersonal skills
                <br />
                3. Deploy them to work on local problems
                <br />
                4. Tag them with local mentors for guidance
                <br />
                5. Track their work progress to award the best performers
                <br />
