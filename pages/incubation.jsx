    para: "Agroshift has designed a digital grocery ordering platform for RMG factory workers and employees providing primarily agro commodities like vegetables, fruits, rice, pulses, milk and meat, along with other daily needs. Workers can place digital orders through a mobile app or physically through ordering kiosks setup at designated places within the factories. Agroshift will fulfill orders by procuring directly from their farmer networks, taking care of the sorting, grading, packaging and delivery at factories, saving time for the female garment workers from doing daily groceries and improving the uptake of nutrition. During the incubation phase, Agroshift will roll out the pilot at Echotex Ltd. (Partner Factory)."

            <div className="text-3xl font-bold mt-5">Futureproofing RMG workplace in Bangladesh- STITCH FOR RMG Announces its First Cohort</div>
            <div className="pt-5 pb-20 text-lg text-justify">
              Launched in October 2021, the STITCH for RMG: Global Innovation Challenge has finally come to an end after three-month-long rigorous competition to crowdsource innovations that can safeguard the livelihood of Bangladeshi women garment workers of the RMG industry. BRAC, H&M Foundation, and The Asia Foundation announced the six winners last Tuesday, 7 February 2022. 
              <br />  
              In the concept stage, 220 teams from 29 countries submitted their concept ideas on the given themes. After being shortlisted, 39 teams submitted pitch videos of their innovations in the pitch round. The judges then finally short-listed 12 finalists and these finalists participated in a virtual marketplace, where a matchmaking process was conducted between the teams and 7 partner RMG factories based in Bangladesh.
              <br />
              The Marketplace Round was a unique opportunity for the finalists to discuss their ideas with factory representatives, through which they were able to understand buy-in of the factories and practicalities of testing their solutions on the factory settings. Through a two week-long phase of mutual introduction and interaction between finalists and partner factories, the finalists finally co-created a joint Expression of Interest (EOI) with their respective matched factories to test these solutions in the factory settings. Finally, an independent judge panel reviewed all these EOIs and finalized 6 winners.
              <br />
              Each winning team will be awarded grants up to USD 30,000 to develop proof-of-concept of the solution. The winners also will receive a wide range of incubation support from BRAC Social Innovation Lab (SIL) to develop proof-of-concept of their model during the next phase.
              Here are the snapshots of the winning teams:

More than 800 submissions were received and 55 short-listed teams were taken through a five-step WATER Challenge where they came up with unique solutions. Finally, three teams were announced as winners in the regional finale in Bhutan.
